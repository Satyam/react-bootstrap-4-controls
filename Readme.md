# Bootstrap v4 components

These components are a minimal implementation, as required by my own needs for an application of mine, of the Bootstrap v4 components and layouts to React. They are not meant to be a complete solution or replacement for [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) which uses Bootstrap v3.

## Installation

```
npm i @devasatyam/react-bootstrap-4-controls
```
